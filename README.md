# Fleet Weather

Work in progress.

The project's objective is to create a Node.js app that continously monitors all vessels in a commercial fleet for the weather at their position and displays it through a friendly user interface. The user would be able to set vessels of interest and maybe even receive notifications in case of upcoming bad weather.

Tools used:

- [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs) for Server-side runtime
- [Express.js](https://github.com/expressjs/express) for HTTP communication with the client
- [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) for web scrapping
- [Pug](https://github.com/pugjs) as template engine

Style and weather scrapping are not yet implemented. Data gets updated automatically without refreshing the page.
