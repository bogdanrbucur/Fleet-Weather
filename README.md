#Fleet Weather

Work in progress.

The project's objective is to create a Node.js app that continously monitors all vessels in a commercial fleet for the weather at their position and displays it through a friendly user interface. The user would be able to set vessels of interest and maybe even receive notifications in case of upcoming bad weather.

Tools used so far:

- [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs)
- [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer)
